## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Storage
- **localStorage**: All user data, course progress, and application state
- **Mock Data**: Pre-defined courses, assignments, and leaderboard data
- **Session Management**: Automatic login state persistence

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User enters any email/password → AuthContext validates → localStorage stores user data
2. Course enrollment → Pending enrollment stored → Sign in required → Auto-enrollment after auth
3. Payment simulation → Success animation → Course added to user's enrolled courses
```

### File Structure (Frontend-Only)
```
/components/          # Reusable UI components
/contexts/           # React contexts (AuthContext)
/pages/              # Page components
/styles/             # Global CSS and Tailwind config
/components/ui/      # Shadcn UI components
```

## 🗑️ Removed Backend Files

The following backend files have been removed or replaced with frontend-only placeholders:

- `/services/api.ts` - Backend API service (replaced with localStorage)
- `/supabase/functions/server/` - Supabase Edge Functions (not needed)
- `/utils/supabase/` - Supabase configuration (not needed)

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Zero Setup Required**: No database, no server configuration
2. **Fast Development**: Instant startup, no backend dependencies
3. **Easy Deployment**: Can be deployed to any static hosting service
4. **Full Feature Set**: Complete EdTech experience without complexity
