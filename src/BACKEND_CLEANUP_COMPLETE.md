# Backend Cleanup Complete âœ…

## Error Fixed

**Issue:** `StudentProfilePage.tsx` was importing `apiService` from `/services/api.ts` which no longer exports the required functions after being converted to frontend-only placeholders.

**Solution:** Removed the backend import and replaced with frontend-only implementation using:
- `useAuth()` hook for user data access
- `localStorage` for data persistence
- Local state management for profile editing
- Mock API delays for realistic UX

## Files Modified

### `/pages/StudentProfilePage.tsx`
- âœ… Removed `import { apiService, UserProfile } from "../services/api"`
- âœ… Added `import { useAuth } from "../contexts/AuthContext"`
- âœ… Added local `UserProfile` interface definition
- âœ… Replaced `apiService.getProfile()` with user data from AuthContext
- âœ… Replaced `apiService.updateProfile()` with localStorage-based persistence
- âœ… Added proper user loading and error handling
