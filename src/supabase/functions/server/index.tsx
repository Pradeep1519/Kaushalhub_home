/**
 * SUPABASE BACKEND REMOVED
 * 
 * This file previously contained Supabase Edge Functions server code 
 * that has been removed as part of converting KaushalHub to frontend-only.
 * 
 * The project now operates entirely in the browser using:
 * - localStorage for data persistence
 * - Client-side authentication via AuthContext
 * - Mock data for development
 * 
 * No backend server setup is required.
