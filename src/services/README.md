# Services Directory Removed

This directory previously contained backend API services that have been removed as part of converting this project to frontend-only.

All authentication and data management is now handled through:
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - User authentication and management
- `localStorage` - Data persistence
- Mock data - For development and demonstration

The project no longer requires any backend services or API calls.
